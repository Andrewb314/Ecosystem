# CenturyLink Cloud  - KB Doc Repository

Inventory of Templates and Draft KB articles for collaboration across the Ecosystem team.  As we move closer to standardizing around the Markdown format, this will make things easier to migrate these over to the new KB once it goes live.  Until then, it will simply make it easier to collaborate as a team around articles and files.
