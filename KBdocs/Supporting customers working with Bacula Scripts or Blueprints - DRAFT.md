# **Description**

CenturyLink has integrated the Bacula network backup solution in to the CenturyLink Cloud platform to enable customers to perform self-service backups. The purpose of this KB article is to help CenturyLink Cloud support personnel understand how to best support our customers and make them successful with this technology. 

Bacula is a set of Open Source, computer programs that permit you (or the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds. Bacula is relatively easy to use and very efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. In technical terms, it is an Open Source, network based backup program.

According to Source Forge statistics (rank and downloads), Bacula is by far the most popular Open Source program backup program.

As a Silver-certified member of the [CenturyLink Cloud Ecosystem Program](https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/58187134-CenturyLink-Cloud-Ecosystem-Program-Guide-), the only thing which CenturyLink Cloud certifies is that the Partner technology deploys successfully to the CenturyLink Cloud.  We provide complementary knowledge-base articles to get the customer started, and we rely up on the Cloud Ecosystem partner to provide their own sales and customer support.

The Script Package will call a Linux install script that will do the following:

*   Identify the Linux platform, RHEL, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu
*   Install the Bacula-FD client from the public repo via apt-get or yum, depending on platform
*   Run a sed command to input the users Bacula-FD password in to the Bacula config file
*   Enable Bacula to start on server boot up via chkconfig
*   [Re]Start Bacula after install
